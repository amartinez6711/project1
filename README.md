-Summary of the project
Display a digital clock in both 12 hour time and 24 hour time
Allow the user to add one hour or one minute to both clocks simultaneously.

What did you do particularly well?
Create a loop that works efficently.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
Creating functions to have less code in the main. This would allow for better debugging, maintainability, and adaptation.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The format of the clocks and the loop to add one hour or minute. I researched online and found solutions on various websites like stackoverflow to help me overcome the issues. 

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
Learning how to create and include functions and using less code in the main. 

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I included in-line comments for all functions of the code.
